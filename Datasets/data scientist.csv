State Of Louisiana - Data Scientist, Tech Director & DBA of CiteSeerX Ville Platte, LA, USA 06/2013 - Present
I started with the web crawling module of CiteSeerX in 2011, then expanded to the full architecture around 2013.
My job duties include administrating the MySQL database and Apache Solr index servers, hacking the source code (Python/Java/Perl) to fix security vulnerabilities, developing new web application features, managing 100+ terabytes production and research data, maintaining 30+ physical and virtual servers to facilitate production and research, and developing software to improve web crawling, information classification and extraction.
By the end of 2014, I was able to run the entire search engine single handed.
In 2015, I proposed infrastructure and software solutions to overcome scalability bottlenecks and blueprinted the next generation of CiteSeerX.
By the end of 2016, I had scaled the data collection from 3 million to over 10 million documents.
Currently, the system can keep running for several months without major issues.
The 200+ page system document wrote by me significantly flattens learning curve for new admins.
I used to assist 3+ professors to build private cloud and GPU infrastructure.

Professional Summary
I am objective-oriented, perseverant and well-organized. I have clear logic thinking, good sense of numbers, and the ability of seeing through mess to catch critical information. Mixed background of social science and engineering cultivates me to be pragmatic, rational but also inter-personally sensitive and considerate. I have years of experience of data mining as well as project-leading and programming in bio-medical and semiconductor metrology fields into which I'd like to dive deeper; when there's chance, I also look forward to extending my exploration to fields like medicine, health care, or education. I'm also open and feel excited to relocate for working overseas.

Senior Data Scientist
Factset Research Systems Inc. – Los Angeles, CA
I've been working as an data scientist in Advanced Metrology Center for 4 years. My job is to extract critical information from mess engineering data in order to figure out the root causes of Lithography process defects in R&D stages including Optical Patterning Correction (OPC), mask making and repairing, and pattern printing. In finding to solution to these tasks, skills of data mining, mathematical modeling and algorithm developing are deeply involved. I also lead and co-work with IT for several projects of methodology developing and system establishing.
I won a Golden Trade Secret Award by the project I led 'Statistical OPC and Process Characterization' in 2015 in which several Statistic-based solutions were proposed to response to those tasks conventionally fixed empirically to help decision makers in making judgment based on objective numerical information and avoiding the risk of manual subjective bias.
06/2012 to 03/2015
Data Scientist
Yahoo! – Omaha, NE
Establishing my domain knowledge of Lithography and Metrology was the main focus of my first two years in TSMC. This was the fundamental work to let me genuinely know about the data I dealt with, the overall Lithography process flow, defective pattern characterizing and recognizing.
In 2014 I won a Buddy Award for being outstanding in coaching new comers.

Education
2012
Master of Science: Industrial Engineering, Data Mining
National Taiwan University (NTU) - Taipei, Taiwan
I co-worked with National Taiwan University Hospital for a project aiming to construct an ensemble classification model which automatically categorized breast tumors into five levels basing on the numerical information extracted from tumor's ultra-sound images. This modeling methodology was patented in Taiwan and the US in 2015.
2004
Bachelor of Arts: Diplomacy
National Chengchi University (NCCU) - Taipei, Taiwan
I got my bachelor's degree in Diplomacy from National Chengchi University; during my college years I'd been given very solid training in language and inter-personal communication. I was a schoolmate envoy who helped foreign students fit in the school smoothly."

Projects
Efficient File Organization based on Sequential Patterns of Files and Blocks : The goal of the project is to access the files faster than the original time by keeping a track of sequential patterns of files and blocks from the logfile. These patterns are trained on a machine learning algorithm and stored those frequently repeated patterns in cache memory so that we can access the files faster than the usual time.
COVID-19 Growth Trend Clustering : The goal of this project is to analyse which countries are beating the pandemic using the publicly available John Hopkins COVID-19 data. We created a statistical model which is a ten-hundred plot and used this for clustering the countries which are mostly affected by COVID-19.
Predicting Lake Mendota and Lake Monona Ice Cover : We used Ed Hopkins data at the Wisconsin State Climatology Office which maintains a listing of the dates and durations of full-freeze ice covers on Madison lakes, Mendota and Monona and developed a regression model to predict the durations of full freeze ice covers for the upcoming years.

Development of KPIs using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for launching 5G Standalone Mode: Developed an algorithm to predict the trend of call model for future dimensioning and addressing any immediate issues implementing ML regressions/classifiers. Basically, this algorithm predicts the traffic handled by Service-Communication Proxy (SCP) functions at the peak time of the day. Automation and visualization was done by deploying the script to Grafana dashboard.
Development of an anomaly detection algorithm from statistical analysis of Diameter Routing Agent (DRA) Nodes: Developed an anomaly detection algorithm by statistically analyzing the trends of requests and responses from diameter protocol based servers and clients (4G Technology) using Python, Pandas, Influxdb and Grafana dashboards to monitor daily traffic of DRA nodes for determining if any change of configuration is required for any of the nine DRA sites.
Software development for Service-Communication Proxy (SCP) audit: Developed several multi-threaded software for SCP audit (5G Technology) to match the network routing information of twelve different SCP sites and generate alarm if any discrepancy is detected.
Development of a web-frame to investigate real-time virtual service data: Developed a web page using Django and Python to scrutinize the queries from REST APIs in real-time.
Graduate Research Assistant, 06/2019 to Current
Norc At The University Of Chicago – Huntsville, AL
Predicting Movement Disorder Symptoms Using Machine Learning Algorithms:
Developed a binary and multi-class approach implementing machine learning algorithms to evaluation of tremor severity based on data remotely recorded by a mobile- or tablet-based drawing application. This work has been used to differentiate between healthy subjects, essential tremor patients receiving deep brain stimulation treatment, and those same patients with treatment disabled. This classification algorithm was highly effective, with overall accuracy of 97.04%.
Windows Application Development
Designed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) in C# to monitor and analyze real-time brain signal from Medtronic's Nexus-D3 and Activa PC+S products. This investigational research tool has been used in the closed loop deep brain stimulation (CLDBS) study, to establish a connection between the implanted neurostimulator (Activa PC+S®, Medtronic INC) in Essential tremor patient and an external computer
Andoird Application Development
Developed a self-administered and noninvasive telemonitoring application using Android Studio in Java programming language and Java Scripts that enables the Essential tremor patients to collect data at home, performs real time statistical analysis and transmit the result over the internet to a dedicated server. This application has been used to collect data from subjects that enables the researchers to develop various tests which cannot be easily performed with paper and pencil.
