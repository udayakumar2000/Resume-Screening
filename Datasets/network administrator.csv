Skills
Routing & Switching
Implement VLAN Trunking Protocol to reduce administrative overhead. Enable secure sharing of VLAN information to prevent the introduction of rogue devices from affecting the VLAN database. Shutdown unused switches ports following Layer 2 security best practices.
Create and manage Local VLANs based on department function, and configure ports with static VLAN assignment and 802.1Q trunks for layer 2 forwarding. Configure edge ports for fast-transitioning into the forwarding state to fix workstation startup connectivity delays.
Configure frame-relay point-to-point and multipoint connections to establish connectivity between each of the four sites as required. Establish frame-relay point-to-point connections three of the sites creating a full mesh. Implement hub and spoke network between three of the sites with the main office as the hub for redundant connections.
Implement EIGRP routing for point-to-point and Non Broadcast Multi-Access networks. Ensure that the spoke routers are receiving routing information about each other from the hub. Configure EIGRP unequal-cost load balancing to also use the lower capacity multipoint links when routing packets.
Prevent neighbor adjacencies from being formed as well as the sending and receiving of routing updates on unnecessary interfaces. Configure EIGRP MD5 Authentication between sites to prevent unauthorized insertion of routes into the domain. Implement manual EIGRP route summarization to reduce routing protocol demand on CPU resources, memory, and bandwidth used to maintain the routing table.
Implement OSPF routing with multiple areas for networks between sites. Implement totally stubby areas to lower the system resource utilization of routing devices for the network. Implement NSSA area to allow injection of external routes into the area and propagation into the OSPF domain.
Voice
Implement a local voice network with the network elements: Cisco 3550 switch with Power-over-Ethernet. Create and manage Data and Voice VLANs, and configure ports with static VLAN assignment and 802.1Q trunks for layer 2 forwarding. Configure edge ports for fast-transitioning into the forwarding state to fix workstation startup connectivity delays.
Configure Fast Ethernet main and sub-interface assignments as required for inter-vlan routing. Implement static routes for local connectivity. Implement NTP server, DHCP server, and TFTP server for support of the VoIP network. Modification of system level parameters including max phones, max directory numbers, display format for date and time, and setting the Time-Zone.
Security
Implement an IPSec Site-to-Site VPN between the Cisco ASA5505 at small office location and Cisco 1841 ISR with a security IOS image at the main office.
Implementations include PAT with NAT exemptions for the VPN traffic on the Cisco ASA5505, and PAT using a route-map to exclude VPN traffic from translation on the Cisco 1841 ISR.
Wireless
Implementation Create and configure dynamic interfaces for VLAN and WLAN association. Create wireless LANs and configure interface association, security parameters, and radios used. Utilize the Wireless LAN Controllers web GUI to configure and manage the wireless network. Configure internal DHCP scopes for WLANs."
