HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER
St Therese Home Of New Hope
The facility which I work at manufactures structural components for the automotive industry in the areas of hot and cold stamping as well as welding. I have full responsibility and accountability for all human resources and payroll related functions at the Goshen plant.
Updated key human resource metrics, including turnover and terminations, using reporting tools on the HRMS database. This allowed the management team to have a snapshot of current trends within our plant.
Payroll Management: Responsible for ensuring competitive compensation and benefit packages according to our internal policies and regulations.
This includes a complete overhaul of our Labor Grade system. This was a major undertaking as we have employees that were not classified correctly and employees that were also not being paid correctly.
Policies & Procedures: Responsible for developing HR policies and programs that address our internal and external changes and challenges.
Built a comprehensive employee recruiting strategy. Utilizing staffing agencies, and direct hires. Responsible for anticipating the recruitment needs of our plant, to ensure adequate staffing in terms of quantity and quality. Implemented a daily open position report so we had accurate and timely oversight of our open positions. Implemented a part-time work force which reduced our costs as we didn't have to pay benefits. This met the needs of the workers that only wanted part time hours, and it filled our open positions that we previously had difficulty filling.
Developed and facilitated all new-hire orientations. Improved the onboarding process so that it was no longer a fully manual process. This saved the time required to bring a new team member on board.
03/2016 to 09/2017

I was able to improve the payroll functions and better automate and integrate our systems across all locations.
Conducted an audit of all positions within the dealerships to ensure employees are properly classified in accordance with the FLSA.
Implemented a program called Paperless Pay. Which allowed us to eliminate printed pay checks. And now it is web based.
Recruitment: Responsible for the oversight of the recruitment for all the dealerships. Ensuring that the appropriate on-boarding for new hires takes place. During my time at Gurley Leep, we implemented iCIMS recruitment and onboarding platform.
Policies & Procedures: Responsible for updating the employee handbook to be compliant with all company policies, as well as all state and federal regulations. The new handbook allowed for consistency across all locations.
Benefits: The oversight of the entire benefits program was my responsibility. And it was my responsibility to be the Project Manager for implementing a web based benefits platform (Benefits Solver). This allowed for enrollments within the system, notifying terminated employees of their Cobra rights, and all other health insurance related items. This system allowed for live feeds to our health insurance related vendors as well.
Legal Compliance: Responsible for working with our legal counsel for investigation of EEOC charges, as well as investigation of internal complaints.

Policies and Procedures: This company had been in business since 2007 prior to my hire date in 2008, there were 3 previous HR Managers.

This allowed for 360 degree feedback and goal setting.
As well as performance review and evaluation.
This allowed our employees and managers to more effectively communicate with each other and understand what is expected of them.
It was my responsibility to develop the personalized templates, based on each job description.
